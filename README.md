# TrainSchedule

This is a train schedule that allows the user to add a specific train with several bits of information.  The information is stored on a firebase database in order to ensure that the information is shared amongst all users.

To get started, all one really needs to do is load the page, and enter in some information about an inbound train.

This project was created by Avery Bradley and is not currently being maintained.
